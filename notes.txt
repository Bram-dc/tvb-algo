X
    represents the membrane potential of the neuron (excitatory or inhibitory).

Y
    represents the synaptic activity or some other state variable related to the neuron's activity.

C
    is the synaptic input received from other neurons in the network, which is derived from the postsynaptic potential from other regions.

K
    is the coupling constant, determining the strength of the interaction between the regions.

f and g
    are functions of the state variables (e.g., nonlinearity and coupling) and can be represented in the equations that govern neural dynamics.
